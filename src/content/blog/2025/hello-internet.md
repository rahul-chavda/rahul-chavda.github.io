Finally, I have my own space on the internet! 🎉

I've always wanted to have a website and blog to showcase my thoughts, projects, and anything intriguing happening
around me. I tried creating a very basic website before, but I wasn’t satisfied with it 😤. But now, I finally have this!

A little backstory: While browsing the internet, I came across a
beautiful [blog](https://kevinyap.ca/2019/12/going-fast-in-advent-of-code/) by Kevin. and I was very impressed by
very minial website that he was having. so I thought of getting some <s>copy paste</s> **inspiration** from him and
start my own journey 😉.

I will be sharing my life journey, opinion, ideas and anything that I care about. I’m excited with this new
chapter and hope you'll enjoy the stories I’ll share along the way!
